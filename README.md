# AI usage
On this assignment i use Gemini AI to help me with syntax, how to use certain Qt method and also some debugging problem, some examples of query are:
1. How do i create, modify and connect a button to a specific function
2. How do i display text and set the coordinate
3. How do i implement method to draw dots using a mouse press
4. How do i implement a pair for QPoint
5. Does Qpoint support built in sort
6. How to fix some build issues 
7. How does paint event handled, how is it called
8. What's the difference between QPoint and QPointF 
9. Why won't my code draw the line, even thought the vector is not empty

Besides that i also use Gemini on specific parts i have troubled with in the pseudocode from the book, like finding the formula to compare points and understanding the concept to decide which point should be kept or removed also how certain point should be connected. 

# Collaboration usage
On this assignment I mainly collaborated with Hansen Nathaniel. Because when i finished my Convex Hull Calculation Hansen also happens to be finishing his Slow Convex Calculation. Since we had each completed half of the task, we decided to discuss and compare our work. We shared our understanding of how both algorithms function, what makes one faster, how the points are compared and stored, and how the convex shape is built. After that, we reviewed each other’s code to better grasp the core concepts, then implemented the algorithms in our own way. In short, our collaboration focused on helping each other understand the algorithm we haven’t work on, while also reviewing and improving our own code. Besides that i also have some discussion with some other friends in the major about how the code works and how the iteration should be counted.

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
